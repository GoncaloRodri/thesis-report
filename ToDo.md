# To-Dos
- [x] Remove Control Scenario from the report;
- [x] Improve Formal Validation with bibliographic references;
- [y] Add a more detail critical reflection on what the results mean to the entire solution
- [x] Connect Obs and Formal Validation Critical Analysis;
- [x] Improve Future Work ((i) change 1st point to point the desire to connect the solution and the Tor software but not directly, like going to forums; (ii) Justify the need of a 'more' distributed testing env â‡’ To approximate even further the resemblance of the real Tor network with the experimental network built to evaluate and validate our solution; and (iii) On the 'Expansion of ML...' point, add suggestions of algorithms and explain further why is good to use other algorithms and refer the possible interest of using non-supervised learning algorithms)
- [] Add graphics/plots/tables (for Poisson and Randomized Response) to Formal Validation to ease the understanding of the relation between the epsilon parameter and the probability function; Also, reflect on this matter and relate to unobservability and performance results, if possible.

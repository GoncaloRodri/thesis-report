  abstract = {Website fingerprinting enables a local eavesdropper to determine which websites a user is visiting over an encrypted connection. State-of-the-art website fingerprinting attacks have been shown to be effective even against Tor. Recently, lightweight website fingerprinting defenses for Tor have been proposed that substantially degrade existing attacks: WTF-PAD and Walkie-Talkie. In this work, we present Deep Fingerprinting (DF), a new website fingerprinting attack against Tor that leverages a type of deep learning called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a sophisticated architecture design, and we evaluate this attack against WTF-PAD and Walkie-Talkie. The DF attack attains over 98\% accuracy on Tor traffic without defenses, better than all prior attacks, and it is also the only attack that is effective against WTF-PAD with over 90\% accuracy. Walkie-Talkie remains effective, holding the attack to just 49.7\% accuracy. In the more realistic open-world setting, our attack remains effective, with 0.99 precision and 0.94 recall on undefended traffic. Against traffic defended with WTF-PAD in this setting, the attack still can get 0.96 precision and 0.68 recall. These findings highlight the need for effective defenses that protect against this new attack and that could be deployed in Tor.},

Additionally, we describe how an attacker can use information about message distinguishability to speed the attack. We simulate our attacks for a variety of scenarios, focusing on the amount of information needed to link senders to their recipients. In each scenario, we show that the intersection attack is slowed but still succeeds against a steady-state mix network. We find that the attack takes an impractical amount of time when message delivery times are highly variable; when the attacker can observe very little of the network; and when users pad consistently and the adversary does not know how the network behaves in their absence.",

abstract = {Website fingerprinting attacks have recently emerged as a serious threat against web browsing privacy mechanisms, such as SSL, Tor, and encrypting tunnels. Researchers have proposed numerous attacks and defenses, and the Tor project currently includes both network- and browser-level defenses against these attacks, but published defenses have high overhead, poor security, or both.In this paper we present preliminary results of {Glove}, a new SSH based defense. Glove is based on the observation that current defenses are expensive not because website traces are different, but because the defense, operating blindly, does not know how to add cover traffic and therefore, puts it everywhere. Instead, Glove uses existing knowledge of a websites traces to add cover traffic conservatively while maintaining high levels of security. Further, Glove satisfies the information theoretic definitions of security defined in prior work -- i.e., it is resistant to any fingerprinting adversary. Our simulations show that Glove performs better than all currently proposed SSH based defenses in terms of the security-overhead trade-off.},

abstract = {We present techniques for efficient anonymous communication with real-time constraints as necessary for services like telephony, where a continuous data stream has to be transmitted. For concreteness, we present the detailed protocols for the narrow-band ISDN (integrated services digital network), although the heart of our techniques-anonymous channels-can also be applied to other networks. For ISDN, we achieve the same data rate as without anonymity, using the same subscriber lines and without any significant modifications to the long-distance network. A precise performance analysis is given. Our techniques are based on mixes, a method for anonymous communication for e-mail-like services introduced by D. Chaum (1981)},

abstract = {Anonymous communications systems generally trade off performance for strong cryptographic guarantees of privacy. However, a number of applications with moderate performance requirements (e.g., chat) may require both properties. In this paper, we develop a new architecture that provides provably unlinkable and efficient communications using a single intermediary node. Nodes participating in these Mix-In-Place Networks (MIPNets) exchange messages through a mailbox in an Oblivious Proxy (OP). Clients leverage Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) to send and receive their messages from the OP while blindly but reversibly modifying the appearance of all other messages (i.e., mixing in place) in the mailbox. While an Oblivious Proxy will know that a client participated in exchanges, it can not be certain which, if any, messages that client transmitted or received. We implement and measure our proposed design using a modified version of Fairplay and note reductions in execution times of greater than 98\% over the na\"{\i}ve application of garbled circuits. We then develop a chat application on top of the MIPNet architecture and demonstrate its practical use for as many as 100 concurrent users. Our results demonstrate the potential to use SFE-enabled "mixing" in a single proxy as a means of providing provable deniability for applications with near real-time performance requirements.},

abstract = {Private messaging over the Internet has proven challenging to implement, because even if message data is encrypted, it is difficult to hide metadata about who is communicating in the face of traffic analysis. Systems that offer strong privacy guarantees, such as Dissent [36], scale to only several thousand clients, because they use techniques with superlinear cost in the number of clients (e.g., each client broadcasts their message to all other clients). On the other hand, scalable systems, such as Tor, do not protect against traffic analysis, making them ineffective in an era of pervasive network monitoring.Vuvuzela is a new scalable messaging system that offers strong privacy guarantees, hiding both message data and metadata. Vuvuzela is secure against adversaries that observe and tamper with all network traffic, and that control all nodes except for one server. Vuvuzela's key insight is to minimize the number of variables observable by an attacker, and to use differential privacy techniques to add noise to all observable variables in a way that provably hides information about which users are communicating. Vuvuzela has a linear cost in the number of clients, and experiments show that it can achieve a throughput of 68,000 messages per second for 1 million users with a 37-second end-to-end latency on commodity servers.},

abstract = {Private communication over the Internet remains a challenging problem. Even if messages are encrypted, it is hard to deliver them without revealing metadata about which pairs of users are communicating. Scalable anonymity systems, such as Tor, are susceptible to traffic analysis attacks that leak metadata. In contrast, the largest-scale systems with metadata privacy require passing all messages through a small number of providers, requiring a high operational cost for each provider and limiting their deployability in practice.This paper presents Stadium, a point-to-point messaging system that provides metadata and data privacy while scaling its work efficiently across hundreds of low-cost providers operated by different organizations. Much like Vuvuzela, the current largest-scale metadata-private system, Stadium achieves its provable guarantees through differential privacy and the addition of noisy cover traffic. The key challenge in Stadium is limiting the information revealed from the many observable traffic links of a highly distributed system, without requiring an overwhelming amount of noise. To solve this challenge, Stadium introduces techniques for distributed noise generation and differentially private routing as well as a verifiable parallel mixnet design where the servers collaboratively check that others follow the protocol. We show that Stadium can scale to support 4x more users than Vuvuzela using servers that cost an order of magnitude less to operate than Vuvuzela nodes.},

abstract = {Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

abstract = {Current anonymous communication systems make a trade-off between weak anonymity among many nodes, via onion routing, and strong anonymity among few nodes, via DC-nets. We develop novel techniques in Dissent, a practical group anonymity system, to increase by over two orders of magnitude the scalability of strong, traffic analysis resistant approaches. Dissent derives its scalability from a client/server architecture, in which many unreliable clients depend on a smaller and more robust, but administratively decentralized, set of servers. Clients trust only that at least one server in the set is honest, but need not know or choose which server to trust. Unlike the quadratic costs of prior peer-to-peer DC-nets schemes, Dissent's client/server design makes communication and processing costs linear in the number of clients, and hence in anonymity set size. Further, Dissent's servers can unilaterally ensure progress, even if clients respond slowly or disconnect at arbitrary times, ensuring robustness against client churn, tail latencies, and DoS attacks. On DeterLab, Dissent scales to 5,000 online participants with latencies as low as 600 milliseconds for 600-client groups. An anonymous Web browsing application also shows that Dissent's performance suffices for interactive communication within smaller local-area groups.},

abstract = {Informally, a communication protocol is sender k - anonymous if it can guarantee that an adversary, trying to determine the sender of a particular message, can only narrow down its search to a set of k suspects. Receiver k-anonymity places a similar guarantee on the receiver: an adversary, at best, can only narrow down the possible receivers to a set of size k. In this paper we introduce the notions of sender and receiver k-anonymity and consider their applications. We show that there exist simple and efficient protocols which are k-anonymous for both the sender and the receiver in a model where a polynomial time adversary can see all traffic in the network and can control up to a constant fraction of the participants. Our protocol is provably secure, practical, and does not require the existence of trusted third parties. This paper also provides a conceptually simple augmentation to Chaum's DC-Nets that adds robustness against adversaries who attempt to disrupt the protocol through perpetual transmission or selective non-participation.},

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy},

abstract = {Tor’s growing popularity and user diversity has resulted in network performance problems that are not well understood, though performance is understood to be a significant factor in Tor’s security. A large body of work has attempted to solve performance problems without a complete understanding of where congestion occurs in Tor. In this article, we first study congestion in Tor at individual relays as well as along the entire end-to-end Tor path and find that congestion occurs almost exclusively in egress kernel socket buffers. We then analyze Tor’s socket interactions and discover two major contributors to Tor’s congestion: Tor writes sockets sequentially, and Tor writes as much as possible to each socket. To improve Tor’s performance, we design, implement, and test KIST: a new socket management algorithm that uses real-time kernel information to dynamically compute the amount to write to each socket while considering all circuits of all writable sockets when scheduling cells. We find that, in the medians, KIST reduces circuit congestion by more than 30\%, reduces network latency by 18\%, and increases network throughput by nearly 10\%. We also find that client and relay performance with KIST improves as more relays deploy it and as network load and packet loss rates increase. We analyze the security of KIST and find an acceptable performance and security tradeoff, as it does not significantly affect the outcome of well-known latency, throughput, and traffic correlation attacks. KIST has been merged and configured as the default socket scheduling algorithm in Tor version 0.3.2.1-alpha (released September 18, 2017) and became stable in Tor version 0.3.2.9 (released January 9, 2018). While our focus is Tor, our techniques and observations should help analyze and improve overlay and application performance, both for security applications and in general.},

abstract = {Tor is a popular anonymity-preserving network, consisting of routers run by volunteers all around the world. It protects Internet users' privacy by relaying their network traffic through a series of routers, thus concealing the linkage between the sender and the recipient. Despite the advantage of Tor's anonymizing capabilities, it also brings extra latency, which discourages more users from joining the network.One of the factors that causes the latency lies in Tor's circuit scheduling algorithm, which allows busy circuits (those with continuous traffic) to crowd out bursty circuits (those with short bursts of traffic). In this work, we propose and implement a more advanced scheduling algorithm which treats circuits differently, based on their recent activity. In this way, bursty circuits such as those used for web browsing can gain higher priority over busy ones such as used for bulk transfer; the performance for most activities over Tor is improved, while minimal overhead is incurred. Our algorithm has been incorporated into the latest build of Tor.},

abstract = {The Tor network is a widely used system for anonymous communication. However, Tor is known to be vulnerable to attackers who can observe traffic at both ends of the communication path. In this paper, we show that prior attacks are just the tip of the iceberg. We present a suite of new attacks, called Raptor, that can be launched by Autonomous Systems (ASes) to compromise user anonymity. First, AS-level adversaries can exploit the asymmetric nature of Internet routing to increase the chance of observing at least one direction of user traffic at both ends of the communication. Second, AS-level adversaries can exploit natural churn in Internet routing to lie on the BGP paths for more users over time. Third, strategic adversaries can manipulate Internet routing via BGP hijacks (to discover the users using specific Tor guard nodes) and interceptions (to perform traffic analysis). We demonstrate the feasibility of Raptor attacks by analyzing historical BGP data and Traceroute data as well as performing real-world attacks on the live Tor network, while ensuring that we do not harm real users. In addition, we outline the design of two monitoring frameworks to counter these attacks: BGP monitoring to detect control-plane attacks, and Traceroute monitoring to detect data-plane anomalies. Overall, our work motivates the design of anonymity systems that are aware of the dynamics of Internet routing.},

abstract = {Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks pose a serious threat to users' online privacy, including for users of the Tor anonymity system. By exploiting recent advances in deep learning, WF attacks like Deep Fingerprinting (DF) have reached up to 98\% accuracy. The DF attack, however, requires large amounts of training data that needs to be updated regularly, making it less practical for the weaker attacker model typically assumed in WF. Moreover, research on WF attacks has been criticized for not demonstrating attack effectiveness under more realistic and more challenging scenarios. Most research on WF attacks assumes that the testing and training data have similar distributions and are collected from the same type of network at about the same time. In this paper, we examine how an attacker could leverage N-shot learning---a machine learning technique requiring just a few training samples to identify a given class---to reduce the effort of gathering and training with a large WF dataset as well as mitigate the adverse effects of dealing with different network conditions. In particular, we propose a new WF attack called Triplet Fingerprinting (TF) that uses triplet networks for N-shot learning. We evaluate this attack in challenging settings such as where the training and testing data are collected multiple years apart on different networks, and we find that the TF attack remains effective in such settings with 85\% accuracy or better. We also show that the TF attack is also effective in the open world and outperforms traditional transfer learning. On top of that, the attack requires only five examples to recognize a website, making it dangerous in a wide variety of scenarios where gathering and training on a complete dataset would be impractical.},

abstract = {We continue a line of research initiated in [10,11]on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user.Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = ∑ig(xi), where xi denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0,1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case.The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive.},
